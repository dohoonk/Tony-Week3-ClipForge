# Product Context: ClipForge

## Why This Exists
Creators need a simple, fast desktop video editor that doesn't require learning complex professional software. ClipForge fills the gap between basic mobile apps and heavy-duty editors like Premiere Pro.

## Problems It Solves
1. **Complexity Barrier**: Professional editors are overwhelming for quick edits
2. **Speed**: Export times are slow with traditional editors
3. **Accessibility**: Many video editors lack intuitive timeline editing
4. **Recording**: Need to capture screen/webcam directly in the editor
5. **Cross-Platform Availability**: Consistent experience across desktop platforms

## How It Should Work

### User Journey
1. **Import**: User selects video files → clips appear in media library
2. **Arrange**: Drag clips to timeline tracks → preview shows composition
3. **Edit**: Trim/split clips by dragging handles → real-time feedback
4. **Record**: Select screen/webcam → record → new clip added to library
5. **Export**: Set output path → export with progress feedback → final MP4

### Core User Experience Goals
- **Fast**: Open app in < 5 seconds, export in near real-time
- **Intuitive**: Timeline manipulation should feel natural
- **Responsive**: 55+ fps timeline scrolling, smooth playback
- **Reliable**: No codec compatibility issues, deterministic exports
- **Lightweight**: < 250 MB total install size

## Key Features
- Media library with clip thumbnails/metadata
- Interactive timeline with drag-and-drop
- Real-time preview player
- Screen and webcam recording
- Single-pass export pipeline
- Project save/load functionality

## Success Definition
An MVP is successful if internal testers can:
1. Import 5+ video clips successfully
2. Create a 2-minute timeline with 3+ clips
3. Trim and rearrange clips
4. Export a working MP4 without crashes
5. Record screen/webcam and integrate into project
